<h1>Sachin Sisodiya</h1>

<p>
Hello, my name is <strong>Sachin Sisodiya</strong>. I am a PhD Economics Candidate at the University of Cincinnati.
</p>

<p>
My research examines the economic, regulatory, and geopolitical dimensions of licit opium production, with a focus on supply chain dynamics, pricing mechanisms, and policy trade-offs. I study how legal opium markets—for pharmaceuticals such as morphine and codeine—interact with global health needs, agricultural livelihoods, and illicit diversion risks.
</p>

<p>
My work applies empirical methods to assess the efficiency, equity, and unintended consequences of opium regulation.
