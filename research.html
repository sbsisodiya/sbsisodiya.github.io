<b>US-China Trade War: Impact on potential trade of their FTA partners</b> - Book Chapter with Swati Singh<br>
Book: The China-US Trade War and South Asian Economies, Routledge Frontiers of Political Economy<br>
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348523981_US-China_trade_war#fullTextFileContent">Full Text PDF</a>
<p>
This chapter explores the impact of the US–China trade war on their respective FTA partners. Covering three crucial sectors – automobiles, electrical machinery, and iron and steel – the chapter tries to understand whether the trade war has benefited the FTA partners of both China and the USA. The study considers two time periods: between 2013 and 2017 as the pre-tariff escalation period and 2018 as the post-tariff escalation period. The chapter comments that the automobile sector of the US has a comparative advantage in the world and the export potential of this sector is more promising than the two other selected sectors. On the other hand, China is the hub of automobile parts, known for electrical machinery and the iron and steel sector. Therefore, China’s export potential in the three selected sectors is very significant and promising for its FTA partners.

<b>Roadblocks towards the Right to Education: Experiences from Delhi</b> - with Vijay Prakash<br>
Economic and Political Weekly, Volume 54, Issue No 50<br>
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349494647_Roadblocks_towards_the_Right_to_Education_Experiences_from_Delhi">Full Text PDF</a>
<p>
This fieldwork experiment examines barriers to implementing India’s Right to Education (RTE) Act in Delhi’s slums, focusing on Section 12(1)(c), which reserves 25% of private school seats for economically disadvantaged children. Through surveys in three slum communities, we found systemic gaps: low awareness of RTE provisions, bureaucratic delays, and schools charging hidden fees despite tuition reimbursements. While learning outcomes for RTE beneficiaries were stronger than in government schools, disparities persisted due to unequal access to materials and coaching. The paper highlights policy failures in accountability and recommends grassroots awareness campaigns, stricter monitoring, and equitable resource distribution to uphold RTE’s promise.

<b>Can Informational Nudges Increase Perception of Risk and Disapproval of Prescription Pain-reliever Misuse?</b> - with Rene Saran — <i>Under review</i>
<p>
We conducted a lab experiment involving 610 undergraduate students at the University of Cincinnati to evaluate the impact of informational nudges on risk perception and disapproval of prescription pain-reliever misuse (PPM). The nudges, derived from NSDUH data, highlighted harmful outcomes associated with PPM in youth and were presented in four variations based on message framing (positive vs. negative) and minimal engagement (inclusion vs. exclusion of a comprehension check). A control group received no nudges. We find that positively framed messages combined with minimal engagement significantly enhanced both the perception of great risk and strong disapproval of regular (once or twice every month) misuse compared to the control group while negatively framed messages with minimal engagement only significantly increased strong disapproval for regular misuse. These effects were strongly influenced by gender and individual behavioral traits. However, we find no significant effects of the informational nudges on risk perception and disapproval for occasional (once or twice every in a lifetime or once or twice every year) and habitual (once or twice every week) misuse frequencies. The findings underscore the importance of framing and engagement as well as tailored messaging strategies in shaping young adults' attitudes toward PPM.

<b>Age of Initiating Prescription Pain-Reliever Misuse and Post-misuse Conditions</b> - with Rene Saran and Nayoung Lee
<p>
This paper analyzes the association between individuals’ age of initiating prescription pain-reliever misuse and their socioeconomic and health conditions post-misuse or after an initial misuse episode (26 years and older). We find that individuals who initiate prescription pain-reliever misuse in pre-adulthood compared to adulthood have statistically significantly higher odds of living in poverty, being on a government assistance program, having lower levels of education, and experiencing lower overall post-misuse health conditions. Moreover, importantly, delaying initiation of misuse by one year in pre-adulthood significantly lowers the odds of having such adverse socioeconomic and health outcomes after an initial misuse episode, now also including the odds of having illicit drug dependence. However, such a delay in adulthood does not lead to any statistically significant reduction in the odds.

<b>Spatial Analysis of Minimum Qualifying Yield and Productivity: Evidence from India’s Legal Opium Farming</b> - with Olivier Parent
<p>
India is one of the few countries engaged in licit opium cultivation under strict government regulation and a structured licensing system in the three Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,
and Uttar Pradesh. As per the Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN), an agency responsible for India’s licit opium production through licensing, India is the only country authorized under the
United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961) to produce opium gum. Numerous regulatory concerns have surrounded licit opium cultivation in India, foremost among
them is the diversion of opium from legal production channels to illicit markets, where it can be processed into heroin and other narcotics. In response, the CBN adopted a forewarning policy
in 1998 to reduce diversion risks and improve regulatory compliance. Under this policy, farmers were notified in advance that they would be required to meet a Minimum Qualifying Yield
(MQY)—defined as a minimum quantity of opium (in kg/ha)—in order to remain eligible for a cultivation license in the subsequent year. In 2019–20, the MQY regime was formally replaced
by a morphine-based criterion known as the Minimum Morphine Yield (MMY), which had been piloted alongside MQY in 2018–19. This policy shift aimed to align incentives with pharmaceutical
objectives by encouraging higher morphine concentration in the harvested gum, rather than simply maximizing raw opium volume. This study presents the first empirical evaluation of the forewarning
policy’s evolution—specifically, its impact on farmer productivity and its spatial spillover effects across villages. We employ a stochastic frontier framework to estimate productive efficiency among Indian
opium farmers across three distinct regulatory regimes: No Forewarning (NF, 1996–1997), MQY (1998–2017), and MMY (2018–2021). 
Preliminary results indicate that the MMY period is associated with consistently higher technical efficiency compared to the two earlier regimes.</p>
