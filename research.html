<b>US-China Trade War: Impact on potential trade of their FTA partners</b> - Book Chapter with Swati Singh<br>
Book: The China-US Trade War and South Asian Economies, Routledge Frontiers of Political Economy<br>
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348523981_US-China_trade_war#fullTextFileContent">Full Text PDF</a>
<p>
This chapter explores the impact of the US–China trade war on their respective FTA partners. Covering three crucial sectors – automobiles, electrical machinery, and iron and steel – the chapter tries to understand whether the trade war has benefited the FTA partners of both China and the USA. The study considers two time periods: between 2013 and 2017 as the pre-tariff escalation period and 2018 as the post-tariff escalation period. The chapter comments that the automobile sector of the US has a comparative advantage in the world and the export potential of this sector is more promising than the two other selected sectors. On the other hand, China is the hub of automobile parts, known for electrical machinery and the iron and steel sector. Therefore, China’s export potential in the three selected sectors is very significant and promising for its FTA partners.
